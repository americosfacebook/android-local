Android Local (android-local)
=======================================

Despite the technological advances brought to the mobile arena, Google's own localisation efforts and the wide distribution and ownership of mobile technology across geographies and cultures most of the languages spoken in the world today find themselves without linguistic representation in Android mobiles and tablets.

This is a public project aiming to simplify the inclusion of thousands of still under or completely non-represented languages in the Android digital space. With your help we aim to develop an easy-to-use templating framework for local teams and volunteers to effortlessly create soft keyboards, auto-correct glossaries, system dictionaries, text-to-speech banks and ultimately localised UI for Android devices in their own languages.

A framework as such would give digitally endangered languages a fighting chance to survive the digital age along with their poetry, history, oral literature and culture.

Aren't the tools out there already?
-------------------------------------------

We all agree that the learning curve of the Android development environment is too steep if you just need to create an installable keyboard and auto-correction glossary. In fact, if someone came up with a keyboard creation software such as Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator or Ukelele for Android we would have the digital curve tamed for the inclusion of local languages in mobiles and tablets and this project could move on to producing keyboards and local linguistic features already.

On the other hand, at a cost of normally $3.000 for the development of an African language soft keyboard whose localisation efforts are the addition of a few extra accents and marks to an existing English layout the cost is prohibitive and not easily justifiable to would-be donors and crowdfunding networks.

The plight of local languages in the digital age
--------------------------------------------------------------

The process of disappearance and extinction of thousands of local languages is being sped up by the lack of elementary digital language tools. This constraint forces native speakers to write on European and other majoritarian languages instead of their own local language.

In many cases, where users insist on using their own local languages on keyboards that do not allow them to write their language properly, their language is substantially degraded and deturped due to the lack of accents, marks and characters that are either dropped or substituted by similar but wrong characters. 

The real effect to the next and future generations
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This lack of representation results in knowledge that can't be found in search engines, can't be published in knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia, can't be used to power system dictionaries, nor benefit from other basic language features enjoyed by major languages such as auto-correct, text-to-speech and word suggestion. Knowledge that won't be passed to this and future generations who in turn are more and more dependent on digital tools to find, consume, produce and share knowledge.

The plight of local languages is unnecessary, whilst mobile and tablets are widely available and instead of requiring a physical keyboard they can carry as many soft language keyboards as a user deems required for their own intellectual and communication needs, manufacturers have already made available the tools for language inclusion. 

We can change this situation.
