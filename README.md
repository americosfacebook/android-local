Android Local (android-local)
=======================================

This is a public project aiming to simplify the inclusion of thousands of still under-represented languages in the Android digital space. With your help we aim to develop an easy to use templating framework for local teams and volunteers to effortlessly create local soft keyboards, auto-correct glossaries, system dictionaries, text-to-speech banks and ultimately localised UI for Android devices.

So how would this work exactly?
-------------------------------------------

A fellow developer once told me that the day someone came up with a keyboard creation software such as Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator or Ukelele for Android and iOS we would have conquered the digital curve for the inclusion of all languages in mobiles and tablets.

Although my friend hasn't considered other factors and issues with language localisation, I still agree with him that the learning curve of both iOS and Android development environments is simply too steep if you just want to create an installable keyboard and auto-correction glossary. At a cost of normally $3.000 for the development of an African language soft keyboard requiring the addition of a few accents and marks to an English or French Android keyboard layout the cost is prohibitive and not easily justifiable.

The template route is the easiest and cheapest in the sense that the master files are provided with detailed instructions to add letters, accents and marks for a keyboard and a list of words in a language for a glossary. One would just need to go to these files and change the parts that are needed to be changed and soon an endangered language would start to have a fighting chance to survive the digital age along with its poetry, history, oral literature and culture.


The plight of local languages in the digital age
--------------------------------------------------------------

Despite the technological advances brought to the digital arena, most of the languages of the world find themselves without any linguistic support in mobile and desktop systems throughout the world.

The process of disappearance and extinction of thousands of local languages is being sped up by the lack of elementary digital language tools. This constraint forces native speakers to write on European and other majoritarian languages instead of their own local language.

In many cases, where users insist on using local languages on keyboards that do not allow them to write their language properly, the local language is substantially degraded and deturped due to the lack of accents, marks and characters that are either dropped or substituted by similar but wrong characters. 

The real effect to the next and future generations
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This results in knowledge that can't be found in search engines, can't be published in knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia, can't be used to power system dictionaries, nor benefit from other basic language features enjoyed by major languages such as auto-correct, text-to-speech and word suggestion. Knowledge that won't be passed to this and future generations who in turn are more and more dependent on digital tools to find, consume, produce and share knowledge.

The plight of local languages is unnecessary, whilst mobile and tablets are widely available and instead of requiring a physical keyboard they can carry as many soft language keyboards as a user deems required for their own intellectual and communication needs, manufacturers have already made available the tools for language inclusion.
